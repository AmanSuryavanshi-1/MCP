# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to enhance the existing Model Context Protocol (MCP) documentation to make it more engaging, visually appealing, and easier to understand for developers of all skill levels. The enhancement will focus on improving analogies, adding visual elements, incorporating interactive components, and ensuring comprehensive technical coverage including protocol specifications, authentication, endpoint definitions, and practical implementation guidance.

4. IF a user needs testing guidance THEN the system SHALL include testing strategies and debugging tips

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a fullstack developer and automation enthusiast, I want to see practical MCP use cases for web development, n8n automations, and AI-powered workflows so that I can leverage MCP in my projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user explores web development use cases THEN the system SHALL provide MCP integration examples for frontend/backend development workflows
2. WHEN implementing n8n automations THEN the system SHALL show how MCP connects AI models to n8n workflows for automated tasks
3. WHEN building AI-powered applications THEN the system SHALL demonstrate MCP servers for database operations, API integrations, and file management
4. WHEN creating development workflows THEN the system SHALL provide examples of MCP servers for code generation, testing, and deployment automation
5. WHEN integrating with popular tools THEN the system SHALL show MCP connections to GitHub, Slack, email services, and cloud platforms
6. WHEN discussing scalability THEN the system SHALL include performance considerations and best practices for production deployments
7. WHEN showing monetization THEN the system SHALL provide business model examples and SaaS implementation strategies

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a mobile or tablet user, I want the documentation to be fully responsive and accessible so that I can learn about MCP on any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the documentation on mobile THEN the system SHALL provide a responsive layout that works on all screen sizes
2. WHEN viewing diagrams on small screens THEN the system SHALL ensure diagrams are readable and interactive
3. WHEN navigating on touch devices THEN the system SHALL provide touch-friendly navigation and controls
4. IF a user has accessibility needs THEN the system SHALL meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer implementing MCP, I want comprehensive protocol specifications and technical details so that I can build robust MCP-compliant applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user needs protocol details THEN the system SHALL provide complete MCP protocol overview with purpose and interface abstractions
2. WHEN implementing authentication THEN the system SHALL document required headers, token scopes, and refresh strategies
3. WHEN defining endpoints THEN the system SHALL specify URL patterns, HTTP methods, payload schemas, and response formats
4. WHEN mapping models THEN the system SHALL provide tables of logical model IDs to provider model names
5. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL document HTTP statuses, error structures, retry logic, and fallback models
6. WHEN managing resources THEN the system SHALL specify timeouts, rate limits, quotas, and quota exceeded handling
7. WHEN monitoring systems THEN the system SHALL define logging fields, metrics tracking, latency, and token usage
8. WHEN versioning APIs THEN the system SHALL explain version bumping, migration notes, and deprecation windows

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a security-conscious developer, I want detailed security and operational guidance so that I can implement MCP safely in production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing security THEN the system SHALL document TLS requirements, CORS policies, and input sanitization
2. WHEN setting up auditing THEN the system SHALL provide auditing hooks and security considerations
3. WHEN following workflows THEN the system SHALL include minimal "hello world" and complex tool-use examples
4. WHEN deploying to production THEN the system SHALL provide operational best practices and monitoring guidance

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer wanting to stay updated, I want links to current resources and community content so that I can access the latest information about MCP.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user seeks additional resources THEN the system SHALL provide curated links to official documentation, tutorials, and community content
2. WHEN referencing external tools THEN the system SHALL include direct links to repositories, installation guides, and examples
3. WHEN showing video content THEN the system SHALL embed relevant tutorials and presentations
4. WHEN providing code samples THEN the system SHALL link to complete repositories and live examples
